The sun also has a gravitational pull on the Earth, which can enhance or reduce the moon's effect on the tides, depending on their alignment.

        "llm_response": "Intracellular\n\nExplanation:\n\nHormone receptors can be classified into two main types: plasma membrane receptors and intracellular receptors. Plasma membrane receptors, also known as transmembrane receptors, are located on the plasma membrane of the cell and bind to hormones outside the cell. Intracellular receptors, on the other hand, are located inside the cell and bind to hormones that have entered the cell.\n\nIntracellular hormone receptors are typically found in the cytoplasm or nucleus of the cell. They are activated when a hormone binds to them, which causes a conformational change in the receptor that allows it to interact with DNA and regulate gene expression. Examples of hormones that bind to intracellular receptors include steroid hormones such as estrogen, testosterone, and cortisol, as well as thyroid hormones.\n\nPlasma membrane hormone receptors, on the other hand, are activated when a hormone binds to them on the outside of the cell. This binding causes a signal transduction cascade that ultimately leads to a cellular response. Examples of hormones that bind to plasma membrane receptors include insulin, epinephrine, and growth hormone.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is that intracellular hormone receptors are located inside the cell, while plasma membrane hormone receptors are located on the plasma membrane of the cell.",
        "formatted_response": "Intracellular\n\nExplanation:\n\nHormone receptors can be classified into two main types: plasma membrane receptors and intracellular receptors. Plasma membrane receptors, also known as transmembrane receptors, are located on the plasma membrane of the cell and bind to hormones outside the cell. Intracellular receptors, on the other hand, are located inside the cell and bind to hormones that have entered the cell.\n\nIntracellular hormone receptors are typically found in the cytoplasm or nucleus of the cell. They are activated when a hormone binds to them, which causes a conformational change in the receptor that allows it to interact with DNA and regulate gene expression. Examples of hormones that bind to intracellular receptors include steroid hormones such as estrogen, testosterone, and cortisol, as well as thyroid hormones.\n\nPlasma membrane hormone receptors, on the other hand, are activated when a hormone binds to them on the outside of the cell. This binding causes a signal transduction cascade that ultimately leads to a cellular response. Examples of hormones that bind to plasma membrane receptors include insulin, epinephrine, and growth hormone.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is that intracellular hormone receptors are located inside the cell, while plasma membrane hormone receptors are located on the plasma membrane of the cell.",

The theory was first proposed by Silvan Tomkins in the 1960s. According to Tomkins, when a person makes a particular facial expression, the muscles involved in that expression send signals to the brain, which then interprets those signals as an emotional state. For example, if a person smiles, the muscles involved in smiling send signals to the brain, which then interprets those signals as happiness. This theory has been supported by some research, but it is still a topic of debate in psychology.",

The aim of daylight saving is to make better use of daylight during the evenings, particularly during the longer days of summer. This means that clocks are set forward by one hour, usually in the last Sunday of October, and then set back by one hour on the first Sunday of April. This results in an extra hour of daylight in the evening during the warmer months and an extra hour of daylight in the morning during the colder months. Daylight saving is not observed in Queensland and Western Australia, although some localities within these states have their own daylight saving arrangements.",
