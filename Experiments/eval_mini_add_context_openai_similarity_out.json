The gravitational pull from these celestial bodies causes water levels to rise and fall, resulting in the cyclical pattern of high and low tides.\n\n2. **Geographical Influence**: The shape of the coastline, the depth of the water, and other geographical features can also affect how tides manifest in different locations. Some areas experience more extreme tides than others due to these factors.\n\n3. **Lunar Cycle**: Tides are affected by the lunar cycle, which lasts about 29.5 days. During a full moon and a new moon, tidal ranges are usually greater (spring tides), while during the first and third quarter phases of the moon, the tidal range is smaller (neap tides).\n\n4. **Other Influencing Factors**: Local weather conditions, such as atmospheric pressure and wind patterns, can also affect tidal movements. For instance, low atmospheric pressure can lead to higher tides, while high pressure can have the opposite effect.\n\n5. **Tidal Prediction**: Tides can be predicted based on the alignment of the Earth, Moon, and Sun, and various tidal charts and predictions are available for coastal areas, which indicate when high and low tides will occur.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that as of January 2018, any specific data regarding recent tidal patterns would depend on the local conditions and specific geographic location being considered, as tides can vary significantly around the world.\n\nIn conclusion, the question is about the scientific and geographical factors that lead to the routine in and out movement of tides, primarily driven by gravitational forces alongside other local influences.", "disambig_prompt_response": "Gravitational forces from the Moon and the Sun.", "ground_truth": ["the rotation of Earth"], "question_distance": 0.7261561735563355, "answer_distance": 0.8440793368462864, "ambig_answer_distance": 0.4197561634318905, "disambig_answer_distance": 0.3875785316045756}, {"data_id": "-8097791269930113460", "ambig_question": "Who played the part of the incredible hulk?", "ambig_prompt_response": "Lou Ferrigno", "disambig_question": "To provide more context and clarity to the question \"Who played the part of the Incredible Hulk?\", it's important to consider the different portrayals of the character in various media, as the Hulk has been represented in both film and television over several decades.\n\nThe character of the Incredible Hulk, originally created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby for Marvel Comics, first appeared in \"The Incredible Hulk\" #1 in 1962.

Some of the primary hormones produced by the kidneys include:\n\n1. **Erythropoietin (EPO)**: This hormone is responsible for stimulating the production of red blood cells in the bone marrow. EPO levels increase when oxygen levels in the blood are low, which helps to improve oxygen delivery to tissues.\n\n2. **Renin**: This enzyme is crucial for the regulation of blood pressure. It is part of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which helps manage blood pressure and fluid balance in the body. Renin is secreted in response to low blood pressure, low sodium levels, or sympathetic nervous system activation.\n\n3. **Calcitriol**: This is the active form of vitamin D, which is produced in response to parathyroid hormone (PTH) and low calcium levels. Calcitriol helps to regulate calcium and phosphate levels in the blood and promotes the absorption of these minerals from the intestine.\n\n4. **Prostaglandins**: While not hormones in the traditional sense, these local signaling molecules are produced by the kidneys and influence various functions such as vasodilation, which helps regulate renal blood flow and blood pressure.\n\nIn summary, when asking about the hormones produced by the kidneys, it's essential to specify their functions, their impact on overall health, and to understand the context concerning kidney-related diseases and treatments available as of early 2018.", "disambig_prompt_response": "Erythropoietin (EPO)", "ground_truth": ["renin", "erythropoietin"], "question_distance": 0.7589967680457193, "answer_distance": 0.7740002573228504, "ambig_answer_distance": 0.715206649862636, "disambig_answer_distance": 0.8845425909514869}, {"data_id": "8213925251473849705", "ambig_question": "When was the mission santa clara de asis built?", "ambig_prompt_response": "1777", "disambig_question": "The question \"When was the mission Santa Clara de As\u00eds built?\" is asking for the specific date or year when the Mission Santa Clara de As\u00eds, a historical site located in Santa Clara, California, was established.

It acts as an intermediary, allowing the processor to access frequently used data quickly.\n\n2. **Levels of Cache**: Cache memory is typically divided into three levels:\n   - **L1 Cache**: This is the fastest and smallest cache, integrated directly into the processor core, usually with a size of 32 KB for data and 32 KB for instructions (64 KB total).\n   - **L2 Cache**: Larger and slightly slower than L1 cache, the L2 cache is dedicated to each core and typically ranges from 256 KB to 1 MB, depending on the specific processor model.\n   - **L3 Cache**: This is a shared cache among all cores in the processor, which is larger, ranging from 2 MB to 12 MB or more in newer models, and slower than both L1 and L2 caches.\n\n3. **Current Context**: As of January 2018, various generations of Intel i7 processors have been released, including the 1st (Nehalem), 2nd (Sandy Bridge), 3rd (Ivy Bridge), 4th (Haswell), 5th (Broadwell), 6th (Skylake), 7th (Kaby Lake), and the 8th generation (Coffee Lake) processors. Each generation might have slight variations in cache size and architecture, but they generally maintain the standard three levels of cache.\n\n4. **Specific Model Examples**: For instance, the Intel Core i7-7700K (7th generation) features:\n   - 32 KB L1 Cache per core (64 KB total)\n   - 256 KB L2 Cache per core (1 MB total for 4 cores)\n   - 8 MB L3 Cache shared among all cores.\n\nThis contrasts with the Intel Core i7-8700K (8th generation), which also has:\n   - 32 KB L1 Cache per core\n   - 256 KB L2 Cache per core\n   - 12 MB L3 Cache shared among all cores.\n\n### Revised Question\n\n**How many levels of cache memory are typically found in Intel i7 processors, and what are the specific characteristics of these cache levels and their differences among various i7 models, particularly as of January 2018?** \n\n### Answer\n\nIntel i7 processors typically include three levels of cache memory: L1, L2, and L3. Each level serves a distinct purpose, with L1 being the fastest and smallest, L2 being larger but slower, and L3 being even larger and slower but shared among all cores. For example, as of January 2018, a common configuration for an Intel Core i7-7700K includes L1 cache of 64 KB, L2 cache of 1 MB, and L3 cache of 8 MB, while the i7-8700K features similar L1 and L2 sizes but has an increased L3 size of 12 MB.

When these hormones bind to their receptors, they typically initiate a signal transduction pathway that leads to a cellular response. Examples include G protein-coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases.\n\n  - **Intracellular Receptors:** These receptors are located within the cell, either in the cytoplasm or the nucleus. They are primarily associated with lipophilic (fat-soluble) hormones such as steroid hormones (e.g., testosterone, cortisol) and thyroid hormones. These hormones can pass through the cell membrane and bind to their respective receptors, leading to changes in gene expression and protein synthesis.\n\n**Disambiguated Question:**\nThe question \u201cWhich type of hormone receptor: plasma membrane-bound or intracellular?\u201d is asking for clarification regarding the classification of hormone receptors based on their location and interaction with different types of hormones.

Carbon-14 is a radioactive isotope of carbon that is formed in the atmosphere when cosmic rays collide with nitrogen atoms.

When an organism dies, it stops absorbing carbon-14, and the isotope begins to decay at a constant rate, known as its half-life, which is approximately 5,730 years. \n\nTo understand the process underlying radiocarbon dating, it is crucial to know that it is based on the decay of carbon-14 through beta decay. In this decay process, a neutron in the carbon-14 nucleus transforms into a proton while emitting an electron (the beta particle) and an antineutrino. This process alters the carbon-14 atom into nitrogen-14, which is stable. \n\nAt the current date, January 2018, the significance of radiocarbon dating continues to impact fields such as archaeology, geology, and environmental science, as it helps researchers date ancient artifacts, fossils, and geological events, allowing for a better understanding of historical timelines.\n\nIn summary, the question \"Radiocarbon dating is based on which decay process?\" is asking for identification of the specific type of radioactive decay that carbon-14 undergoes, which is beta decay.", "disambig_prompt_response": "Beta decay.", "ground_truth": ["radioactive decay"], "question_distance": 0.717657639459874, "answer_distance": 0.9999988167616655, "ambig_answer_distance": 0.6145489854535169, "disambig_answer_distance": 0.6146024663151602}, {"data_id": "4096998143061999225", "ambig_question": "Who sings she's got bette davis eyes?", "ambig_prompt_response": "Kim Carnes", "disambig_question": "The question asks about the artist who performs the song \"Bette Davis Eyes,\" which was famously released in the early 1980s.

Are we discussing the first organized form of government known to history, such as tribal leadership, kingdoms, or modern democratic systems?\n\n2. **Historical Context**: If we're looking at the earliest known forms of government, the Sumerians in Mesopotamia are often credited with developing one of the first city-states around 3000 BCE, complete with administrative systems and leaders known as 'lugals' or kings. However, other ancient civilizations, such as those in Egypt and the Indus Valley, also had sophisticated forms of governance around the same time.\n\n3. **Types of Governance**: Different kinds of governance structures have emerged over time, including monarchies, oligarchies, democracies, and republics. Clarifying which type you are interested in could lead to different answers.\n\n4. **Cultural Significance**: It might also be worthwhile to consider how different cultures define and perceive government, as indigenous methods of governance may predate written records.\n\nTaking this additional context into account, if the current date is January 2018, and we want to address your question based on the interpretation I've provided, the formation of the first recognized government structure is generally associated with the rise of city-states in ancient Mesopotamia around 3000 BCE as part of the Sumerian civilization. \n\nIf you have a particular era, region, or type of government in mind, providing that additional context could lead to a more specific answer!", "disambig_prompt_response": "Around 3000 BCE.", "ground_truth": ["Roman and Greek"], "question_distance": 0.7479789293652442, "answer_distance": 0.7366422602347582, "ambig_answer_distance": 0.3039726471302296, "disambig_answer_distance": 0.2505244090105724}, {"data_id": "-3159168804915677632", "ambig_question": "When did the movie country bears come out?", "ambig_prompt_response": "July 26, 2002.", "disambig_question": "The question \"When did the movie Country Bears come out?\" is asking for the release date of the film \"The Country Bears,\" which is a family musical comedy film produced by Walt Disney Pictures.

For example, the film \"The Strangers\" features characters who engage in predatory behavior during the night, resulting in heightened fear and suspense.\n\n3. **Metaphorical Interpretation:** If \"strangers\" is meant metaphorically, it could allude to unknown or unfamiliar forces that emerge during vulnerable times, such as the night. This interpretation could delve into the psychological or societal implications of how fear of the unknown manifests, particularly after dark.\n\nIn providing an answer based on these interpretations, please specify which aspect you are most interested in exploring regarding the \"strangers\" and their predatory behavior at night.", "disambig_prompt_response": "Nocturnal predators such as owls and foxes.", "ground_truth": ["March 9 , 2018"], "question_distance": 0.6918876628119978, "answer_distance": 0.24972105479137777, "ambig_answer_distance": 0.28638544289188533, "disambig_answer_distance": 0.060010758938063}, {"data_id": "-5505435431090988506", "ambig_question": "Snow white and the huntsman movie heroine name?", "ambig_prompt_response": "Snow White", "disambig_question": "The question \"Snow White and the Huntsman movie heroine name?\" is seeking the name of the main female character in the film \"Snow White and the Huntsman,\" which was released in 2012. \n\nTo clarify, \"Snow White and the Huntsman\" is a fantasy action film that presents a darker interpretation of the classic fairy tale \"Snow White.\" The film features several key characters, but the heroine, who is also the title character, is named Snow White.

In the context of the U.S. government, there are specific processes outlined in the Constitution.\n\n1. **Impeachment Process**: The power to remove the president begins with impeachment, which is primarily a political process. The House of Representatives has the authority to impeach the president by a simple majority vote. This means that if a majority of House members vote in favor of impeachment, the president is formally charged with misconduct.\n\n2. **Trial in the Senate**: If the president is impeached by the House, the process then moves to the Senate, where a trial is conducted. The Senate serves as the jury in this trial, and it requires a two-thirds majority vote to convict and remove the president from office. \n\n3. **Grounds for Impeachment**: The Constitution specifies that the president can be impeached for \"Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\" The interpretation of these terms is often influenced by political considerations as well as legal definitions.\n\n4. **Historical Context**: As of January 2018, there has been recent discussion regarding the potential for impeachment of President Donald Trump, who took office on January 20, 2017. Conversations surrounding his actions and decisions have raised questions about possible grounds for impeachment, highlighting the role of multiple stakeholders, including Congress, in the process.\n\n5. **Political Considerations**: It's important to note that the impeachment process is inherently political, and the decision to impeach a president often involves deep partisan divides and public opinion. The dynamics in Congress, the party in control of both chambers, and public support or opposition can all significantly affect the process.\n\nIn summary, the power to remove the president of the United States lies with Congress, specifically the House of Representatives and the Senate, through the impeachment process defined by the U.S. Constitution.", "disambig_prompt_response": "Congress", "ground_truth": ["the legislature"], "question_distance": 0.7178784242667953, "answer_distance": 0.8858342139948434, "ambig_answer_distance": 0.5778771692706951, "disambig_answer_distance": 0.5929130413993391}, {"data_id": "-4008064114384973136", "ambig_question": "When will dragon ball super english dub be released?", "ambig_prompt_response": "The English dub of Dragon Ball Super is complete and available.", "disambig_question": "The question \"When will Dragon Ball Super English dub be released?\" seeks to find out the release dates for the English dubbed version of the anime \"Dragon Ball Super.\" As of January 2018, \"Dragon Ball Super\" is an ongoing series produced by Toei Animation, based on the popular \"Dragon Ball\" franchise created by Akira Toriyama.

Rome and Carthage both had strategic interests in the island, which at the time was crucial for trade and military advantage. The war primarily involved naval battles, and ended with Rome's victory and the acquisition of Sicily as its first province.\n\n2. **Second Punic War (218\u2013201 BC)**: This war is famous for the Carthaginian general Hannibal Barca's audacious crossing of the Alps to invade Italy. The conflict was sparked by territorial disputes in Spain and resulted in numerous significant battles, including the Battle of Cannae, where Hannibal achieved a decisive victory against a much larger Roman force. Ultimately, Rome managed to turn the tide and secure victory by invading North Africa and defeating Hannibal at the Battle of Zama.\n\n3. **Third Punic War (149\u2013146 BC)**: This war was largely driven by the Roman desire to eliminate Carthage as a rival power once and for all. After a prolonged siege, Rome managed to capture the city of Carthage, leading to its complete destruction in 146 BC.

This war was fought over the contested succession to the Spanish throne and aimed to prevent the union of the French and Spanish crowns under a single Bourbon monarch.\n\n2. **Political Implications**: The treaty significantly altered the political landscape of Europe at the time. It marked the decline of French hegemony under Louis XIV and helped establish a balance of power that would prevent any one nation from dominating Europe, thus laying groundwork for future diplomatic relations and conflicts.\n\n3. **Colonial Consequences**: Various territorial adjustments were made in the Americas and other colonies, with Great Britain gaining significant territories.

The USS Maine was a United States Navy battleship that sank in Havana Harbor, Cuba, on February 15, 1898. This explosion played a significant role in escalating tensions between the United States and Spain, ultimately leading to the Spanish-American War.\n\nAt the time of the incident, there were several theories regarding the cause of the explosion, with varied opinions about responsibility. The most widely accepted narrative initially blamed Spain's actions, as tensions were high due to Cuba's struggle for independence from Spanish rule. Public sentiment in the U.S., fueled by sensationalist journalism (often referred to as \"yellow journalism\"), strongly pointed towards Spanish culpability, with the rallying cry \"Remember the Maine, to Hell with Spain!\" becoming a popular slogan.\n\nHowever, there were also arguments suggesting that the explosion was caused by an accidental coal dust explosion or a malfunction of the ship rather than an intentional act of sabotage or war against Spain. The subsequent naval inquiry conducted by the U.S. government concluded that a mine was the likely cause of the explosion, implicating Spanish involvement indirectly.\n\nAs of January 2018, discussions around the sinking of the USS Maine remain relevant in historical analysis, debates about media influence in public opinion, and the complexities of international relations. \n\nWith this context in mind, the disambiguated question could be rephrased as: \"In light of the historical context surrounding the USS Maine explosion on February 15, 1898, who was primarily blamed for the incident, and what were the competing theories regarding its cause?\"", "disambig_prompt_response": "Spain.", "ground_truth": ["Spain"], "question_distance": 0.7192022000741723, "answer_distance": 0.9999999999999999, "ambig_answer_distance": 0.8997913366903018, "disambig_answer_distance": 0.8997913366903018}, {"data_id": "6389345907245133102", "ambig_question": "When was the national world war ii memorial built?", "ambig_prompt_response": "2004", "disambig_question": "The question \"When was the national world war ii memorial built?\" can be disambiguated and enriched by including additional context regarding the memorial's significance, location, and construction details. \n\nThe National World War II Memorial is located on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., and honors the 16 million people who served in the U.S. armed forces during World War II.
