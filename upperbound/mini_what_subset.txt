The Land Ordinance of 1785 was passed by the Confederation Congress and aimed to organize the settlement of the northwest territory, which encompassed lands north of the Ohio River and west of Pennsylvania.\n\nTo disambiguate the question further, it\'s helpful to specify various groups that the ordinance may have benefited:\n\n1. **Land Speculators**: The ordinance allowed for the systematic surveying and sale of land, which provided opportunities for land speculators to purchase large tracts of land at a relatively low cost and potentially profit from reselling it as demand increased.\n\n2. **Settlers and Farmers**: By creating a clear method for acquiring land, it encouraged ordinary citizens, including farmers, to settle in the northwest territory, offering them the chance to own property and cultivate it for subsistence and economic gain.\n\n3. **The Federal Government**: The ordinance helped to generate revenue for the federal government through land sales, which was especially important for a country seeking to stabilize its finances after the Revolutionary War.\n\n4. **Expansionists**: The ordinance facilitated westward expansion and promoted the idea of Manifest Destiny among Americans, leading to a belief in the right to expand the United States across the continent.\n\n5. **Future Generations**: The establishment of a land distribution system set a precedent for future territorial governance and the eventual statehood of regions in the northwest territory, impacting generations of settlers and residents.\n\nBy identifying these specific beneficiaries, one can understand the broader implications of the Land Ordinance of 1785, beyond just who may have profited directly from its passage. \n\nAs of January 2018, historical interpretations of this legislation continue to influence discussions about land rights, settlement patterns, and the legacy of federal land policies in the United States.', 'add_context_answer': 'Land Speculators.', 'what_disambig_answer_distance': 0.4094596531514986, 'add_context_disambig_answer_distance': 0.4094596531514986, 'baseline_answer_distance': 0.4094596531514986, 'distance_between_baseline_and_what': 0.9999990411669814, 'distance_between_baseline_and_add_context': 1.0000000000000002, 'question_distance_between_baseline_and_what': 0.9237706295074335, 'question_distance_between_baseline_and_add_context': 0.7940355293169017}

However, as the demand for aviation increased post-World War I, the company began to diversify into aircraft engines. The significant transition into jet engine production occurred after World War II.\n\nThe first jet engine produced by Rolls-Royce was the "Eagle", which was developed in the late 1940s. It was used in the Avro Lincoln bomber and made its first flight in 1949. The company gained further prominence in the jet engine sector with the introduction of the "Derwent" engine in 1944, which powered several aircraft during World War II, but it was the developments in the 1950s that marked the foundation of Rolls-Royce as a leading manufacturer of jet engines for commercial and military aircraft.\n\nThus, while the production of jet engines began in earnest in the late 1940s, the company laid the groundwork much earlier with the development of turbojet and turbofan technologies.\n\nNow, to directly answer the question: Rolls-Royce started making jet engines in the late 1940s, with important developments occurring throughout the early 1950s.

As of January 2018, Australia has several desalination facilities, especially in regions facing water scarcity, such as Sydney and Melbourne.\n\nDesalination refers to the removal of salt and other impurities from seawater to make it suitable for human consumption and irrigation. The two most common processes used in Australian desalination plants are:\n\n1. **Reverse Osmosis (RO)**: This is the predominant method utilized in many desalination plants across Australia. In this process, seawater is forced through semi-permeable membranes under high pressure. The membranes allow water molecules to pass through while blocking larger salt and mineral particles, effectively creating fresh water on one side and a concentrated brine solution on the other.\n\n2. **Multi-Stage Flash Distillation (MSF)**: While less common than reverse osmosis in Australia, some desalination plants may use multi-stage flash distillation. This method involves heating seawater to create steam, which then condenses into fresh water as it cools. The remaining concentrated brine is removed from the system. This process is energy-intensive and is typically used in regions with abundant energy resources.\n\nAs of early 2018, these desalination plants are crucial in addressing water shortages caused by droughts and increasing demand for potable water in urban areas across Australia. The brine produced during the desalination process is usually discharged back into the ocean, raising questions and research opportunities regarding its environmental impact. \n\nIn summary, the question seeks to understand the technical processes involved in desalination—as practiced in Australia—as a solution to water scarcity issues.', 'add_context_answer': 'Reverse Osmosis (RO)', 'what_disambig_answer_distance': 0.9116095299267998, 'add_context_disambig_answer_distance': 0.8921052867586272, 'baseline_answer_distance': 0.9104440171386105, 'distance_between_baseline_and_what': 1.0, 'distance_between_baseline_and_add_context': 0.8570585151511247, 'question_distance_between_baseline_and_what': 0.9476742714995776, 'question_distance_between_baseline_and_add_context': 0.7384402297097559}

The term "heir apparent" refers to the individual next in line to ascend to the throne, who, at the time, is expected to succeed the current ruler upon their death or abdication.\n\nIn 1914, the heir apparent to the Austro-Hungarian Empire was Archduke Franz Ferdinand.

This system is notable for its introduction of zero as a number and its use in mathematics, which was a significant advancement over earlier numeral systems used in Europe.\n\nThe introduction of the Indian numbering system to Europe occurred primarily through the work of scholars and traders beginning in the medieval period.

They primarily bind to water-soluble hormones (e.g., peptides and catecholamines) that cannot cross the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane. When a hormone binds to these receptors, it typically activates a series of intracellular signaling pathways, often involving second messengers such as cyclic AMP (cAMP) or calcium ions. Examples include insulin receptors and adrenergic receptors.\n\n2. **Intracellular Receptors**: These receptors are found inside the cell, either in the cytoplasm or the nucleus. They bind to lipid-soluble hormones (e.g., steroid hormones like cortisol, testosterone, and thyroid hormones) that can easily diffuse through the cell membrane. Once the hormone binds, the receptor typically undergoes a conformational change that allows it to interact with DNA, influencing gene expression and thus having a long-term effect on cellular function. \n\nIn summary, the distinction hinges on the type of hormones being discussed and their solubility:\n\n- **Plasma Membrane-Bound Receptors** are associated with water-soluble hormones.\n- **Intracellular Receptors** are associated with lipid-soluble hormones.\n\nAs of January 2018, if you are evaluating a specific hormone or a class of hormones, it would be helpful to specify which hormone you are referring to in order to determine the appropriate type of receptor involved.

Its teachings influenced social and political life in the Netherlands, and it has had a significant impact on various communities globally, particularly in regions like South Africa, where Dutch settlers established congregations.\n\n4. **Modern Day**: By January 2018, the Dutch Reformed Church had undergone significant changes, including denominations splits and mergers, particularly the unification with other Reformed churches to form the Protestant Church in the Netherlands (PKN) in 2004.\n\nIn summary, when asking "Where does the Dutch Reformed Church come from?" one should consider its historical roots linked to the Protestant Reformation in the 16th-century Netherlands, its geographical foundation in the reformed teachings from Calvin, and its enduring influence on both Dutch culture and the global Protestant movement as of January 2018.', 'add_context_answer': 'The Netherlands.', 'what_disambig_answer_distance': 0.42974525757716836, 'add_context_disambig_answer_distance': 0.9188780935541552, 'baseline_answer_distance': 0.9189190723567792, 'distance_between_baseline_and_what': 0.4403516712643992, 'distance_between_baseline_and_add_context': 0.9999991961350295, 'question_distance_between_baseline_and_what': 0.8967430375426028, 'question_distance_between_baseline_and_add_context': 0.8207770403958147}

These conflicts took place over a span of approximately 120 years, with the first war starting in 264 BC and the last one concluding in 146 BC. \n\nTo clarify the context of your question: \n\n1. **First Punic War (264–241 BC)**: This war was primarily fought over control of Sicily, which was strategically valuable for trade and military operations. Rome and Carthage clashed naval and land armies during this conflict.\n\n2. **Second Punic War (218–201 BC)**: This war is perhaps the most famous of the three, largely due to the Carthaginian general Hannibal’s bold strategy of crossing the Alps with his army, including war elephants, to invade Italy. Rome ultimately emerged victorious due to the leadership of generals like Scipio Africanus, culminating in the decisive Battle of Zama in 202 BC.\n\n3. **Third Punic War (149–146 BC)**: This final conflict resulted in the complete destruction of Carthage. The Romans besieged the city for three years before capturing and annihilating it, marking an end to the Carthaginian Empire. \n\nSo, when asking "Who did Rome fight against in the Punic Wars?", the answer specifically refers to the city-state of Carthage. The implications of these wars were profound, marking Rome\'s transformation into a dominant Mediterranean power and leading to centuries of Roman influence following the defeat of Carthage.

However, some smokers and businesses initially resisted the changes, citing concerns over personal freedoms and the impact on local pubs and venues.\n\nIn summary, smoking in the workplace in the UK largely ceased following the implementation of the Health Act 2006, which took effect in July 2007 in England.

This theory implies that if you smile, for example, you might actually feel happier, as the act of smiling can send signals to your brain that enhance your mood.\n\nThe origins of this hypothesis trace back to the work of psychologist **Charles Darwin**, who, in the late 19th century, discussed how expressions are a part of emotional experience. However, the formal development of the facial feedback hypothesis as we understand it today is often attributed to **Paul Ekman** and **William James**. James was an early psychologist who theorized about the connection between emotional experiences and physiological responses, while Ekman conducted extensive research on emotions and facial expressions.\n\nMoreover, previous research in the 1980s by **John Strack, Leonard Martin, and Sabine Stepper** further supported the hypothesis through various experiments showing that people\'s emotional states could be influenced by their facial expressions.\n\nIn summary, when asking "Who came up with the facial feedback hypothesis?" it’s important to recognize that while many figures contributed to its development, the more contemporary understanding often credits Ekman alongside earlier theorists like James.

It was established primarily for the purpose of trading in the East Indies, particularly in spices and later in other goods like tea, textiles, and more.\n\nTo disambiguate the question, we can consider whether the inquiry is focused on the initial establishment of the company itself or its specific operations in India. Here are the expanded points of clarification:\n\n1. **Establishment of the Company**: The East India Company was granted a royal charter by Queen Elizabeth I on December 31, 1600. This charter allowed the Company to trade in the East Indies, but it was not specifically focused on India at that time.\n\n2. **First Arrival in India**: The East India Company\'s first significant operations in India began in the early 17th century. They established their first factory (trading post) in Surat in 1613, marking the beginning of their direct engagement in Indian trade.\n\n3. **Expansion in India**: Over the subsequent decades, the Company\'s presence expanded into various regions of India, including the establishment of significant trading centers in cities such as Madras (now Chennai) in 1639, Bombay (now Mumbai) in 1668, and Calcutta (now Kolkata) in 1690.\n\n4. **Colonial Era**: The Company gradually transitioned from a commercial enterprise into a political power, culminating in its rule over large parts of India until the British Crown took control in 1858 following the Indian Rebellion of 1857.\n\nThus, if the question seeks to identify the specific year when the East India Company began operating in India, the crucial dates to note would be 1600 (establishment of the Company), and 1613 (establishment of its first factory). If the question aims to understand the broader context of the Company\'s activities and its eventual dominance in India, a more detailed explanation about its expansion and political influence could be provided.\n\nIn conclusion, it is important to specify whether you\'re asking about the foundation of the company itself or its establishment of operations within India.', 'add_context_answer': '1613', 'what_disambig_answer_distance': 0.6167486089944557, 'add_context_disambig_answer_distance': 0.5387778497773928, 'baseline_answer_distance': 0.6167196764809663, 'distance_between_baseline_and_what': 1.0000000000000002, 'distance_between_baseline_and_add_context': 0.6143474303166458, 'question_distance_between_baseline_and_what': 0.9666137902512697, 'question_distance_between_baseline_and_add_context': 0.7704100728643638}

The question "Build and dependency management tool for Java platform?" pertains to software solutions that assist developers in managing project builds and external library dependencies when developing applications in Java. \n\nTo provide further clarity:\n\n- **Build Tool**: This refers to software that automates the process of compiling source code into binary code, packaging binary code into executable files, and managing the associated configuration files. It simplifies the process of software development, allowing developers to focus on writing code rather than managing compilation processes manually.\n\n- **Dependency Management**: This involves managing the external libraries and frameworks that a Java project depends on. These dependencies must be resolved to ensure that the correct versions are used, avoiding conflicts and ensuring compatibility.\n\nSome popular tools that fit this criteria include:\n\n1. **Apache Maven**: A widely-used tool that provides a project management framework and dependency management capabilities. It uses an XML file (pom.xml) to define project structure and dependencies, making it easy to manage and build projects.\n\n2. **Gradle**: A flexible and powerful build automation tool that allows developers to define their build processes in a domain-specific language (DSL) based on Groovy or Kotlin. Gradle is known for its speed and ability to manage dependencies efficiently.\n\n3. **Ant**: An older, XML-based build tool that is less common nowadays but was widely used for build automation. It allows for custom tasks and configurations, although it lacks built-in dependency management features, which often necessitated the use of additional tools.\n\n4. **SBT (Simple Build Tool)**: Primarily used for Scala projects but also supports Java, SBT offers both build and dependency management capabilities. It emphasizes a more interactive and incremental build process.\n\nConsidering that the current month is January 2018, it is important to note that these tools might have undergone updates or changes since then, and there may be newer tools or versions available in the market.

The Safavid policy of promoting Shiism made it a safer haven for those who felt threatened by Sunni-majority regions.\n\n2. **Political Refugees:** Various political dissidents from neighboring regions, such as the Ottomans and the Uzbeks, took refuge within the Safavid Empire. They may have fled persecution or conflict, seeking asylum in a new territory with a different ruling ideology.\n\n3. **Artisans and Merchants:** The empire was also a center of trade and culture, attracting artisans and merchants from various regions looking for economic opportunities. The Safavid rulers encouraged skilled tradespeople to contribute to the empire’s economy and development.\n\n4. **Nomadic Tribes:** Various nomadic tribes sought protection and autonomy under the Safavid rule as they navigated the shifting political alliances and conflicts in the region.

As of January 2018, the legal age to smoke varies by state. However, the U.S. Federal government raised the national minimum age to purchase tobacco products from 18 to 21 years. This change was implemented through the Tobacco 21 law, which was signed into law in December 2019, but it didn’t affect laws in play as of January 2018. Therefore, many states continued to allow tobacco sales to individuals aged 18 and older during that time.\n\nTo provide further clarity, the following aspects could be relevant:\n\n1. **State Laws**: Each state has the authority to set its own legal smoking age. Before the federal law change, some states had already raised their legal smoking age to 19 or 21.\n\n2. **Local Ordinances**: Certain cities or counties may have local laws that specify a higher legal smoking age than the state law.\n\n3. **Enforcement**: Even if a person is of legal age to smoke, there are regulations regarding where they can smoke and the sale of tobacco products to minors that are enforced by local venders, schools, and law enforcement agencies.\n\n4. **Health Awareness Campaigns**: There are numerous public health campaigns aimed at discouraging smoking among youth, which may influence perceptions about the legal smoking age.\n\nIn summary, while the general principle is that many states were allowing legal smoking at 18 years old as of January 2018, the broader context surrounding tobacco laws is evolving, and individuals should remain aware of both state and local legislation regarding tobacco use.', 'add_context_answer': '21 years old.', 'what_disambig_answer_distance': 0.621790632812278, 'add_context_disambig_answer_distance': 0.4354246071981119, 'baseline_answer_distance': 0.6220002572152181, 'distance_between_baseline_and_what': 1.0, 'distance_between_baseline_and_add_context': 0.5377988166184376, 'question_distance_between_baseline_and_what': 0.8040705331658957, 'question_distance_between_baseline_and_add_context': 0.7248750155713745}
