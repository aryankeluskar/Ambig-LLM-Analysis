      "\n",
      "1. **U.S. House of Representatives**: The impeachment process begins in the House of Representatives. The House has the sole power to impeach the President. This process usually starts with an investigation by a committee, such as the House Judiciary Committee. If the committee finds sufficient grounds for impeachment, it will draft articles of impeachment. A simple majority vote in the House is required to approve the articles. If the articles are approved, the President is considered impeached, which is similar to an indictment in criminal law.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **U.S. Senate**: Once the President is impeached by the House, the process moves to the Senate, where a trial is conducted. The Senate has the sole power to try all impeachments. Senators act as jurors, and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court presides over the trial when a President is being tried. For the President to be removed from office, a two-thirds majority vote of the Senators present is necessary. If convicted, the President may be removed from office and potentially barred from holding future office, but this decision is separate from criminal charges, which would be handled by the judicial system.\n",
      "\n",
      "The impeachment process is thus a two-step procedure involving both houses of Congress, reflecting a system of checks and balances intended by the framers of the Constitution.\n",
      "In the United States government, the process of impeaching the President involves both the House of Representatives and the Senate, each playing distinct roles as outlined in the Constitution.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **House of Representatives**: The impeachment process begins in the House of Representatives. It holds the constitutional authority to initiate impeachment proceedings. Any member of the House can propose an impeachment resolution, or the House can authorize an inquiry or investigation to gather evidence and determine whether grounds for impeachment exist. The House Judiciary Committee often conducts investigations and hearings related to the charges. If the committee finds sufficient grounds, it will draft articles of impeachment. To impeach the President, a simple majority vote in favor of at least one article is required by the full House. The approval of articles of impeachment by the House is the equivalent of an indictment in a criminal case.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Senate**: Once the President is impeached by the House, the process moves to the Senate, which has the sole authority to conduct the impeachment trial. The Senate is responsible for holding a trial to determine whether the President should be removed from office. During this trial, members of the House act as prosecutors (often referred to as \"managers\"), while the Senate acts as the jury. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court presides over the trial when it involves the President. A two-thirds majority vote in the Senate is necessary to convict and remove the President from office.\n",

      "In summary, the House of Representatives has the power to impeach the President by approving articles of impeachment, while the Senate conducts the trial and decides whether to convict and remove the President from office.\n",
      "In the United States, the impeachment process is a constitutional mechanism designed to remove a sitting President, Vice President, or other federal officials from office for committing \"high crimes and misdemeanors.\" The process involves two distinct roles played by the House of Representatives and the Senate.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **House of Representatives**: The House has the sole authority to initiate the impeachment process. It begins with an investigation into the alleged misconduct by House committees. If sufficient evidence is found, the House Judiciary Committee typically drafts articles of impeachment. These articles are then debated and voted upon by the entire House. A simple majority vote (more than half of the members present and voting) is required to impeach, which means formally charging the official with wrongdoing.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Senate**: Once the House votes to impeach, the process moves to the Senate, which has the sole authority to conduct the subsequent trial. The Senate trial is presided over by the Chief Justice of the United States when the President is the one being tried. Senators act as the jury, and witnesses may be called. Conviction and removal from office require a two-thirds majority vote in the Senate. If the Senate votes to convict, the President is removed from office, and they may also be barred from holding future federal office.\n",

Following his death, there was a transition period during which Abdul Halim Khaddam served as the interim president for a short time. Ultimately, Hafez al-Assad's son, Bashar al-Assad, succeeded him and became the president of Syria. Bashar al-Assad officially took office on July 17, 2000.\n",
      "Following the death of Hafez al-Assad in June 2000, his son Bashar al-Assad became the President of Syria. Hafez al-Assad had been in power since 1971, and his death paved the way for Bashar's leadership. Bashar al-Assad was groomed for succession in the years leading up to his father's death. \n",
      "\n",
      "Key developments in this transitional period included changes to the Syrian constitution that lowered the minimum age requirement for presidential candidates, thereby allowing the 34-year-old Bashar to be eligible. After his father's death, Bashar was nominated by the ruling Ba'ath Party and subsequently confirmed as President in a national referendum held in July 2000, where he reportedly received overwhelming support. This marked the continuation of the Assad family's rule over Syria.\n",
