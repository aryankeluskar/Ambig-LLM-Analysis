        "add_context_question": "To clarify the question regarding the NFL record for the most sacks by a team in a single game, it is important to specify the context and details surrounding this record. \n\n1. **Definition of Sacks**: A sack occurs when a defensive player tackles the quarterback behind the line of scrimmage before he has a chance to throw a pass. This is a critical defensive play in football, as it not only disrupts the offensive play but can also result in a loss of yards.\n\n2. **Historical Context**: The record for the most sacks in a single game can vary over the years, as it is subject to change with each NFL season. As of January 2018, it is important to note the specific teams and games that have contributed to this record.\n\n3. **Current Record**: As of January 2018, the NFL record for the most sacks by a team in a single game is 12. This record was set by the Chicago Bears against the New York Jets on October 14, 1984. \n\n4. **Recent Trends**: While the record has stood for many years, it is worth considering how defensive strategies and rules have evolved in the NFL, potentially affecting the frequency of sacks in games.\n\n5. **Relevance**: Understanding this record can provide insights into defensive prowess in the NFL and highlight standout performances by teams and players.\n\nIn summary, the question is asking for the specific record of the most sacks achieved by a single NFL team in one game, with the current record being 12 sacks set by the Chicago Bears in 1984, as of January 2018.",
